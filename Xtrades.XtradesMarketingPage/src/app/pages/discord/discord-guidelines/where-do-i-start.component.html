    Only our analysts can post in 

🚀｜stock-alerts, 
📋｜stock-watchlists, 
🚀｜options-alerts, and 
📋｜options-watchlists .

 If you are new, focus on those channels.

Other paid members can post in 

🗣｜stock-plays and 
🗣｜options-plays 

but we hold our analysts to a higher standard. That is why you should focus on the alert channels unless you are experienced.

All subscribers also have access to our Xtrades Mobile BETA App (iOS and Andorid). The app gives you the alerts without the chat, lets you subscribe to only the analysts you want to follow, filter by trade type, and has some information on win-rates.
Additionally, you can click next to the channel name at the top for a full description of the channel.

What is the difference amongst Elite, Elite Gold, and Platinum Lifetime?
Elite gives you access to the premium channels, 🚀｜stock-alerts 
🚀｜options-alerts 
📋｜stock-watchlists 
📋｜options-watchlists
 🌊｜options-flow . 

You also have access to our mobile-beta app that gives you the alerts without the chat, the ability to follow only certain analysts, and to filter the types of alerts you want.
Elite Gold has additional 
🖥｜algo-discussion (where custom indicators and scripts are discussed, updated, and shared), algo-trades-beta , algo-swing-beta, and 

📚｜trading-resources . The algorithmic signal channels are in beta and those signals require manual chart review but we have received positive feedback thus far. 

📚｜trading-resources is where our custom scanners, scripts, and indicators are shared for E*TRADE, ThinkorSwim, Trade-Ideas, and Finviz.
Platinum Lifetime is a one-time payment and includes 2 hours of mentoring with one of our analysts. While all members are free to message our analysts, due to our server size, we cannot guarantee a timely response without the mentoring package.
