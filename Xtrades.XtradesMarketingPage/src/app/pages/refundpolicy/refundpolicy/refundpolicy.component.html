      All sales are final, and that is why we provide a 14 day free trial of our Elite Monthly plan to allow users the
      ability to understand and know exactly what they are getting before they make a purchase to continue. Refunds are
      only available in the cases of duplicate payments or overcharges. Your payment data is encrypted and secure. All
      amounts shown are in USD.

      Premium Item Access
    </div>
    <div class="hero__description format-text mb-20" description>
      When you purchase our Yearly or Lifetime membership, you are gaining access to our database of
      ThinkorSwim, Trade-Ideas and Tradingview scripts, thus once the purchase is made, we are not able to provide a
      refund for your purchase or reverse the purchase.
