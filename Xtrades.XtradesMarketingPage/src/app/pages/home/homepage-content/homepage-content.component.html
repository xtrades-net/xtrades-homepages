<h3>DECODING COPY, SOCIAL, OPTIONS, AND STOCK TRADING</h3>
<div class="description">While some people might use them as synonyms and say they are the same, they couldn't be more incorrect.</div>

<ul class="clear-list-style">
    <li class="description px-2">01. Stock trading simply refers to buying and selling shares in a specific company to make money with the daily changes in its value. When you buy a stock, you own a piece of the company.</li>
    <li class="description px-2">02. Social trading allows users to observe different traders' journeys with a primary focus on community with access to tons of reliable data.</li>
    <li class="description px-2">03. Copy-trading, on the other hand, is a subset of social trading. These concepts involve following the trading journeys of other traders who have proven successful with their trading habits and methods. Copy trading is literally what the name suggests. It allows users to mimic the trading habits of other investors. This also means that you will make whatever transactions their does. If they sell, you sell.</li>
    <li class="description px-2">04. Options trading is about buying or selling stocks, NFTs, at a specific price within a specific date. This also offers buyers the flexibility to not buy security at a particular date or price. The differentiator lies in its volatility. While stocks can be risky and vulnerable, options trading tends to be riskier.</li>
</ul>

<div class="description">
    Every trading type comes with its pros and cons with strategies and measures that may or may not work. The key lies in decision-making. For instance, copy trading can be a high-risk trading method if you end up following an unsuccessful trader.
