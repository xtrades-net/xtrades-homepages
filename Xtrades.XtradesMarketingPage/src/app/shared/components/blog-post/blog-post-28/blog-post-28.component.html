<h2 id="1">Advanced trading involves having the right tools for the job</h2>

<p>
  If you decided (perhaps unwisely) one day to build a new house all by
  yourself, you wouldn't go to your plot of land and start putting up planks and
  pouring concrete immediately with no blueprints or any plan of action. Even if
  you somehow got a structure built, it's likely your house would fall apart
  because you didn't put the work into crafting your home and assessing the work
  along the way.
</p>

<p>
  Unfortunately, inexperienced stock traders take this approach every day when
  they start buying equities and options. They go in without a plan and, more
  importantly, the tools necessary to determine whether getting into a trading
  position is a good idea or not. One big difference between traders who are
  just gambling their money and experienced traders who find success is using
  tools such as
  <a
    href="https://xtrades.net/blogs/trading-scripts-and-trading-channels"
    target="_blank"
    >trading scripts</a
  >
  and stock channel indicators and alerts.
</p>

<p>
  At <a href="http://xtrades.net" target="_blank">Xtrades</a>, analysts and
  staff traders use (and sometimes even publish) a wide variety of scripts,
  scanners, and price-monitoring stock channel tools to build their trading
  houses. They know that a trading account that will last has to be built on a
  solid foundation.
</p>
<p>
  In this blog post, we'll take a look at how to find some of these scrips and
  channel indicators and how to best use them.
</p>

<h2 id="2">Getting started with trading scripts</h2>

<p>
  First off: don't be afraid to ask, "What exactly are trading scripts?" Scripts
  are basically any software tool, like say an algorithm, that can give you
  useful data or visuals you need to help you make decisions on stock, options
  or futures trading. That's it. You might also hear the term "Indicators" used
  to describe scripts. Typically an indicator is a tool that you'd use on a
  stock chart that would give you specific information overlaid on that chart.
</p>
<p>
  For instance, you might find a script that world on the popular charting
  software TradingView that uses
  <a
    href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bollingerbands.asp"
    target="_blank"
    >"Bollinger Bands"</a
  >
  methodology. A Bollinger Bands script would combine a moving average line on
  the chart for a stock that you're following and would also contain two
  standard-deviation lines that would help you see when a stock is being
  oversold or overbought.
</p>
<p>
  Using settings for that script (also known as an "indicator" like we
  mentioned), you might be able to adjust the length of time for the middle
  line's moving average and how much standard deviation you want to see on the
  chart. By studying a chart with this information, you might have a better idea
  of when to enter a trade (if, say, a stock price is rebounding from the lower
  trend line) or when to sell (when the stock price is not able to clear the
  upper trend line).

</p>

<p>
  You might also find some indicators or scripts listed as "Strategies":
  typically, these are scripts that can be backtested to see how they would have
  performed historically.

<h2 id="3">How to explore channels for stock-market trading</h2>

<p>
  When you hear "Channels," you might think of television or different parts of
  a Discord server.
</p>

<p>
  But in stock trading, a channel is a pricing range that a stock, option or
  other asset is trading in. That accounts for its rises and falls and can be
  really useful in determining whether a stock is poised to break out of its
  pattern positively, or if it might fall below that range.
</p>

<p>
  While a stock might be in a longer-term rising or falling pattern, it could
  still go up and down in the short term. Channels help us see what the overall
  trend is and whether it's worth trading long or short on that stock or option.
</p>

  />
</div>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic">
  In this chart, we can see that the asset's channel is in a downward trend.
</p>

<p>A few reasons to watch channels for stocks include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Easily visualizing a stock's upper channel, where it might be overbought and
    ready to come back down.
  </li>
  <li>
    Easily visualizing a stock's lower channel, where it might be oversold and
    ready to bounce back up.
  </li>
  <li>
    Spotting trends where a stock could be breaking out of its channel. These
    can be good opportunities to make money on a long position when a stock
    breaks out above the trend line or to profit from shorting when it falls
    below the trend.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Combining scripts and channel trading with

  can be a powerful way to stay informed on your trades

  As we said in the beginning of this post, trading without a plan is like
  building a house with no foundation and no blueprints. While nothing is
  certain when trading stocks or options, traders who have the right tools at
  their disposal create an advantage for themselves over those who are investing
  blindly.
</p>

<p>
  In this blog post, we've outlined why traders might want to use scripts (also
  known as indicators) to follow assets they want to trade and the advantage
  that channel trading stocks has for spotting longer-term trends. We've also
  told you about the library of scripts and other trading tools that Xtrades
  <a href="https://app.xtrades.net/shop/" target="_blank"
    >has available for its members</a
  >.
