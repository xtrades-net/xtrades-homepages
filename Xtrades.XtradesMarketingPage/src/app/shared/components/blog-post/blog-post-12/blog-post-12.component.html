The world of stock trading can be daunting for those who are new to it. This blog post will walk you through everything necessary to get started, from buying your first shares all the way up to achieving success on Wall Street! We'll cover basic information like how much money one should invest with a brokerage account and some tips & tricks designed just as much towards beginners like yourself looking to make their experience successful. So whether or not this is something currently happening within your life - whether you are trying out different financial avenues because finances aren't going quite right lately - you're covered. Learning how to start stock trading can help in your journey to financial success!

<h3 class="center">The Basics Of Buying Stocks</h3>

You first need to understand what a stock actually *is*. A stock is simply a share in the ownership of a company - when you buy shares of Apple, for example, you become an owner (albeit a very small one) of the company. When the company makes money, you do so too - and that's why people invest in stocks! To buy stocks, we must demystify them a little.
<br />
Now that we know what stocks are, let's talk about how actually *to buy* them. This part can be confusing because there are two ways to buy stocks: through a broker or directly from the company itself. However, if you're interested in buying stocks directly from the company, you can do so by contacting their investor relations department.
<br />
You should also know that there are two types of stocks: common and preferred. Common stock is what most people think of when they think of stocks - it's the type that gives you voting rights within the company. Preferred stock, however, doesn't give you voting rights but typically pays a higher dividend.
<br />

<h3 class="center">Things You Need To Get Started</h3>

Now that you understand the basics of buying stocks let's discuss what you need to start. The first thing you need is a brokerage account. This is an account that allows you to buy and sell stocks.
<br />
The second thing you need is money. How much money you need will depend on the stock brokerage you use and the type of account you open. For example, the xtrades app requires a minimum deposit of $500 for cash accounts and $0 for margin accounts.

The third thing you need is a list of potential stocks to buy. You can find this list by researching on your own or speaking with a financial advisor.
<br />
The fourth and final thing you need is a strategy. An excellent place to start is by downloading the xtrades ios app or xtrades app on Play Store to learn from our social trading platform. Our platform allows you to learn from and copy the strategies of successful traders.

<h3 class="center">The Different Ways To Invest In The Stock Market</h3>
Now that you know the basics of starting stock trading, let's talk about the different ways you can invest in the stock market.
<br />
A mutual fund is an investment that allows you to pool your money with other investors and then have it professionally managed by a team of experts. Mutual funds typically charge fees for the initial investment (the front-end load) and ongoing management (the expense ratio).
<br />
An ETF is similar to a mutual fund but trades like a stock on an exchange. For beginners, ETFs can be a good way to invest in the stock market because they offer diversification and are often less risky than individual stocks. ETFs also typically have lower fees than mutual funds.
<br />
Buying stocks through a brokerage account is the most direct way to invest in the stock market. When you buy stocks, you become an owner of the company and are entitled to a share of its profits. However, stocks are also the riskiest investment because their value can go up or down very quickly.
<br />
A final way to invest in the stock market is through real estate investment trusts (REITs). REITs are companies that own or finance income-producing real estate. They typically pay high dividends, making them a good choice for investors who want regular income. There are many different ways to invest in the stock market, and each has its own pros and consâ€”the best way to decide which method suits you is to speak with a financial advisor.

<h3 class="center">Deciding How Much To Invest and When To Sell</h3>

Now that you know the basics of how to start stock trading, it's time to talk about deciding how much to invest and when to sell.
When it comes to deciding how much to invest, there are two schools of thought. 

<ol>
    <li>First, you should only invest what you can afford to lose. This means investing only a small percentage of your overall portfolio in stocks. The second school of thought is that you should invest as much as possible because the more you invest, the greater your potential return.</li>
    <li>Ultimately, the decision of how much to invest is up to you and should be based on your risk tolerance. If you're willing to take on more risk, you may want to invest more of your portfolio in stocks. However, if you're risk-averse, then you may want to keep a smaller percentage in stocks.</li>  
</ol>

<h3 class="center">When it comes to deciding when to sell, there are also two schools of thought.</h3>

<ol>
    <li>First, you should hold onto your stocks for the long term and only sell if the company is in financial trouble or if you need the money for something else. The second school of thought is that you should regularly review your portfolio and sell any stocks that are not performing well.</li>
    <li>Again, the decision of when to sell is up to you and should be based on your investment goals. If you're investing long-term, you may want to hold onto your stocks even when they're not doing well. However, if you're looking to make a quick profit, then you may want to sell stocks that are not performing well.</li>
</ol>

<h3 class="center">Strategy to Choose Stocks Worth Investing</h3>
The final step in starting stock trading is to develop a strategy for choosing stocks worth investing in.
<br />
There are many different ways to choose stocks, but one popular method is to use a stock screener. A stock screener allows you to filter stocks based on specific criteria. For example, you can use a stock screener only to see stocks that are trading below their 52-week high or have a market capitalization of $500 million or more.
<br />
Another popular method for choosing stocks is to follow the recommendations of analysts. Analysts are professionals who study companies and make recommendations about whether they believe the stock will go up or down. 
<br />
Social trading with the xtrades app can teach you how to start stock trading and so much more. You can use social trading to follow other investors' recommendations and learn from their investment strategies.

    Types Of Accounts And Other Things You Need To Understand
</h3>
The final step in starting stock trading is understanding the different types of accounts and other things you need to know.
<br />
There are two main types of accounts: cash and margin. A cash account requires you to pay for your stocks in full, while a margin account allows you to borrow money from your broker to buy stocks. 
<br />
There are also two main types of orders: market orders and limit orders. A market order is an order to buy or sell a stock at the current market price, while a limit order is an order to buy or sell a stock at a specific price. 
<br />
Finally, it's essential to understand what short selling is. Short selling is when you sell a stock that you do not own and hope to repurchase it at a lower price so you can profit from the difference. 

<h3 class="center">The Mindset and Discipline You Need As A Beginner</h3>
The final step in starting stock trading is understanding the mindset and discipline you need as a beginner.
<br/>
When it comes to the stock market, there are two main things you need to know: what you're buying and when you're buying it. 
<ol>
    <li>It would help if you also had a firm understanding of your investment goals. Are you investing for the long term or the short term? How much risk are you willing to take on?</li>
    <li>It's also essential to have patience and discipline when it comes to investing. You shouldn't expect to make a lot of money overnight, and you should be prepared for ups and downs in the market.</li>
    <li>Finally, staying informed about what's happening in the investing world is essential. You can read books, listen to podcasts, and follow financial news outlets.</li>
</ol>
You also need to develop the mindset of a successful investor. This means having confidence in your ability to pick winning stocks, being patient, and staying disciplined. 
<br />
Successful investors also have a strong understanding of the stock market and know when to buy and sell stocks. They are also continually learning and constantly trying to improve their investment strategies. 
<br />
If you can develop the mindset and discipline of a successful investor, you'll be well on your way to becoming one.
