<h2>The market moves fast, you need the tools to keep up with it.</h2>

<p>
  The markets move quickly, whether you're trading stocks, options, futures or
  even cryptocurrency. Especially in the case of options, a small, sudden
  movement on a stock price can be the difference between a losing trade and one
  that's profitable.
</p>

<p>
  But given that traders, like everybody else, have other work and people they
  want to spend time with, how is it possible to stay on top of price movements
  without being stuck staring at your computer monitor or smartphone screen all
  day?
</p>

<p>
  Traders who want to have a life outside of trading must master the use of
  real-time alerts. By setting up parameters for when you get those alerts, what
  information they contain, and what actions should be taken on those alerts,
  you can free up time and attention without missing a key trading moment.
</p>
<p>
  At <a href="http://xtrades.net" target="_blank">Xtrades</a>, analysts and
  staff traders set up alerts that give them an edge over the market; a couple
  of minutes or even precious seconds can help maximize profits on a trade or
  avoid big losses when there's a drastic price change.
</p>
<p>
  There are lots of ways to set up alerts and use them. We'll go over a few easy
  ways to start utilizing real-time alerts, whether they're real-time stocks
  trackers, real-time stock news alerts, or real-time trade alerts, for your
  trading activity.
</p>

<h2>Setting up basic pricing alerts</h2>

<p>
  We'll start by talking about the most basic type of alert, which is very
  commonly used by traders and may be the most useful for day-to-day monitoring
  of the market and assets: price alerts.
</p>
<p>
  Let's say you are an investor in Tesla (TSLA) and you know that you'd like to
  sell some of your stock at a certain price, say $250 a share. You could set an
  order with your broker to sell your stock at that price. But setting an alert
  using your broker's software, an app, or charting software like TradingView,
  might be better. When you get the alert on your smartphone, as a pop-up on
  your computer, or as an email, you can decide what action to take. You might
  notice that Tesla has made a huge announcement or that the stock is trading at
  very high volumes, which might prompt you to hold on to the stock a little
  longer to see what happens.
</p>
<p>
  By the same token, a sudden downswing on a stock or the market as a whole
  might be useful if you've set an alert on an index such as SPY, which is made
  up of tech-sector stocks. An alert about a massive drop in SPY might clue you
  in on changes in the tech sector that might warrant selling some of your
  holdings before things get worse. That same alert might also be a signal to
  consider buying in on a dip if you think a rebound is coming.

  An example of a pricing alert on SPY, a commonly traded ETF, in the charting
  software TradingView. Setting alerts can keep you abreast of sudden price
  shifts in stocks, options and other commodities you might be trading.
</p>

<p>
  These types of alerts give you more flexibility to not monitor the market
  every moment. Hasselhoff, a top trader on Xtrades, says alerts are key to how
  he works.
</p>
<p>
  "Stock alerts are an absolute MUST for selling options and more passive 'set
  it and forget it' type trading," - he says. "If I didn't have an alert set up,
  that would completely undermine the style of trade because now I HAVE to
  monitor it every second rather than setting up my initial sell position.
  Alerts enable me to work AND trade."
</p>
<p>
  Some advanced traders also set up alerts based on more sophisticated
  conditions than a single stock ticker's movement. "Scanners" are tools that
  can spot trends and sometimes help pick out good stocks and options to invest
  into.
</p>
<p>
  Alexander_96, a senior analyst at Xtrades, suggests setting up alerts for
  prices near gaps on stock's chart: those are areas where the stock had a
  sudden upward or downward jump that left a gap in pricing.
</p>

<p>
  "Setting price alerts at unfilled gaps is a good way to have potential trade
  setups for the future," he says. "Gap-fill trades can have consistent and fast
  momentum once price has entered the unfilled price zone."
</p>

<h2>Keeping up with news alerts</h2>

<p>
  If you follow a specific set of stocks or a business sector, news alerts are
  another key tool. While some traders focus on technical analysis of a stock's
  price movement, knowing the fundamentals of a company, including its financial
  health and news such as product announcements and upcoming earnings report
  events, can also give you an edge.
</p>
<p>
  Financial websites such as Seeking Alpha and Benzinga focus on business news,
  but you can also set up news alerts on the Wall Street Journal, Barron's and
  even Google News and Apple News. For these sites you might set up keyword
  alerts or alerts based on the stock tickers you want to follow.
</p>
<p>
  Not all news creates big pricing moves in stocks, but typically earnings
  reports and news of things like a stock split or an acquisition can create big
  swings in the value of a stock.
</p>

<h2>Trade alerts keep you on top of your accounts</h2>

<p>
  The last type of alerts we'll discuss are those involving your own holdings;
  these are trade alerts you'd set up on your broker. The options for alerts
  vary from broker to broker, but most offer a way to stay up to speed on what's
  happening with your holdings, whether it's through emails, daily confirm
  statements or push alerts to your phone.
</p>

<p>Some types of alerts you might want to set up with your broker include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Any time stocks or options are sold from your account.</li>
  <li>Orders that have been canceled or expired.</li>
  <li>
    Large percentage changes in stocks that you trade. Some brokers such as
    Firstrade send these alerts by default to users of their mobile app.
  </li>
  <li>Trading halts on stocks that you own or are interested in following.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Setting trade alerts, whether they're based on pricing, news, or your own
  brokerage account activity, are a good way to stay informed as a trader
  without devoting every moment of the day to watching the markets.
