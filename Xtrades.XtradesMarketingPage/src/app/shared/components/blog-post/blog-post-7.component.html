Swing trading is a type of investment strategy that allows traders to hold positions for more extended periods, typically days or weeks. Swing traders typically buy stocks with the intention of selling them at a higher price in the future. This differs from day trading, which is the practice of buying and selling stocks within the same day. Swing trading has many benefits over day trading, including lower risk, greater profitability, and less stress.
