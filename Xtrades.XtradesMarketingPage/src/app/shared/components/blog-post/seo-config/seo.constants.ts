Yes strategy includes how to do technical analysis and pick trades but it more importantly tells you when to get out. You must have a plan to take profits as soon as you can while leaving more contracts on the table and continue taking profits. If you exit a trade that was green because it made a sudden move downwards; not only did you lose your unrealized profits but you also cut your chances of making money once that trade rebounds. Watch our strategy videos."

                Call option sweeps: Sweeps are a type of trade made by large investors. While Block trades are trades of 10,000 shares or more made on one exchange. Sweeps on the other hand are large trades made over many exchanges. Sweeps and Blocks are identified, grouped and presented in Options Flow software to help traders get a better idea as to what stocks are being traded by Institutional investors who are the ones that make these types of trades."

                Users on the platform and through the iOS and Android apps can track other investors' advice and track records, allowing for upvoting to improve the investor's advice for other users. 
                
                The interactive nature of XTrades provides a more democratic version of investing advice, giving top performers a more extensive reach and exposure than they may otherwise receive."
